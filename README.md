## Instructions

1. Write a function, `h1Selector`,  that selects all `<h1>` elements and returns them using an element selector.
2. Write a function, `liInOlSelector`,  that selects and returns all `<li>` inside of `<ol>` using a descendant selector.
3. Write a function, `linkSelector`,  that selects and returns the `<a>` that is inside of the element that has both an id of box4 and a class of box5.
4. Write a function, `imageSelector`,  that selects and returns the image of the cat that has the alt text equal to "cat sleeping".
